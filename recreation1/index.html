        <ol>Reason 1: It's Xiao... Look at him!
          <br>
          Reason 2: He's a highly capable, and easily buildable, DPS.
          <br>
          Reason 3: EVIL CONQUERING!!
        </ol>
          <p>Truthfully, though, my favorite character and main Genshin DPS, Xiao, is my comfort character and I relate to him a lot. He is a silent person who likes to take action towards a good outcome rather than using frilly words. He's kind even through his cold exterior and would do anuthing to protect the people of Liyue and, most of all, his friends.</p>
          <p>I made this from 3am-4am... Please don't judge because I'm tired and wanted to use my comfort character as a last hurrah :')</p>
          <p>Also, he does big pp damage.</p>
