<p>I'd say my favorite color is indigo because it reminds me of space :)</p>

<p>One of my favorite artworks would have to be from an artist named StarEmber!</p>

<strong>Something I'm Excited about:</strong>
<p>I'm pretty excited about being able to major in Computer Programming while also being able to take art classes. I chose Columbia to be able to balance my career path (Programming) and my passion (Art) at the same time. </p>
<strong>Something I'm Not Excited About:</strong>
<p>I'm not excited to be asked about my grades all the time. They could be all A's but that's all I'm gonna be asked about this year for conversation in my family.</p>
