          <li>Normal Attack: Deals up to 4 spear strikes.</li>
            <li>Charged Attack: Consumes a set amount of stamina to lunge forward, dealing damage to enemies.</li>
            <li>Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer (Elemental Skill): Thrusts with his spear, dealing electro damage.</li>
             <p>"When Cyno is under the Pathsworn Pathclearer state triggered by the Elemental Burst "Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness," he will instead unleash a Mortuary Rite that deals thunderous AoE Electro DMG and extends the duration of Pathsworn Pathclearer" (Genshin Impact Wiki).</p>
             <li>Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness (Elemental Burst): Cyno morphs into the Pactsworn Pathclearer and his normal and charged attacks are now imbued with electro damage.</li>
             <p>"Pactsworn Pathclearer: Cyno's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be converted to Electro DMG that cannot be overridden. Cyno's Elemental Mastery and resistance to interruption will increase, and he gains immunity to Electro-Charged DMG. This effect will be canceled when Cyno leaves the field and lasts a maximum of 18s" (Genshin Impact Wiki).</p>
             <li>The Gift of Silence (Utility Passive): After a 20 hour expedition in sumeru, Cyno gains 25% more rewards.</li>

             <p>"When Cyno is in the Pactsworn Pathclearer state activated by Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness, Cyno will enter the Endseer stance at intervals. If he activates Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer while affected by this stance, he will activate the Judication effect, increasing the DMG of this Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer by 35%, and firing off 3 Duststalker Bolts that deal 100% of Cyno's ATK as Electro DMG.
        Duststalker Bolt DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG." (Genshin Impact Wiki).</p>
